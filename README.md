## Swot

Strengths: All components are examples from lectures making the project manageable.
Weaknesses: The project implements video which could cause problems.
Opportunities: The project has the potential to have a lot of layers creating a an engaging platform.
Threats: The project has to be configured properly so that others can't access the data or manipulate it.
