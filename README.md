## Swot

Strengths: All components are examples from lectures making the project manageable.
Weaknesses: Simplictic, design will need to be good to create engagement.
Opportunities: The project has the potential to add different features like the ability to delete.
Threats: The project has to be configured properly so that others can't access the data or manipulate it.
